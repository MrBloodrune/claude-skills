# Vault Structure

Folder taxonomy for the RMV0 Obsidian vault at `~/Documents/rmv0/`.

## Root Folders

| Folder | Purpose | Filing Rule |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `Daily/` | Daily journal notes (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) | NEVER create notes here. Only edit today's daily note in designated sections. |
| `Inbox/` | Uncategorized items | Use when uncertain. Better here than wrong folder. |
| `Technology/` | Tech topics, tools, research | Default for anything tech-related |
| `Technology/Dev/` | Software, coding, homelab | Code, programming, dev tools, infrastructure |
| `Technology/Observation/` | Tech observations | "Noticed X does Y" — not active research |
| `Finance/` | Money, budgets, expenses | Anything involving money |
| `Social/` | People, relationships, events | Content primarily about people |
| `Social/DnD/` | D&D campaign notes | Game session notes, characters, loot |
| `Plans/` | Goals, planning | Future-oriented content |
| `Plans/Games/` | Gaming plans | Game wishlists, gaming goals |
| `Content/` | Content creation, media | Things to create, consume, or learn |
| `Canvas/` | Obsidian canvas files | NEVER create files here programmatically |
| `Templates/` | Note templates | NEVER modify. Read-only. |
| `Attachments/` | Images, PDFs, files | NEVER create files here programmatically |
